All type of Rental Classes extend abstract class.
All type of rental classes are made immutable.
RentByFamily class expects RENT_BY_HOUR,RENT_BY_DAY or RENT_BY_WEEK input in rental type to calculate corresponding total cost.

3.Depend on abstraction rather than concretion.
4. Seperate what changes into differnt method.
